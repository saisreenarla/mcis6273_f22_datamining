    "1. I have learned about jupyter Notebook, GitHub Repository, and Machine Learning (on the Server side Python modules(pandas, numpy, matplotlib) and on the front end is Javascript).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. My reaction is about this podcast is i inspired and gained knowledge through this podcast.\n",
    "   Moreover, i pointed that Adam discussed in the interview about github. I agree about his point about the github because the main reason is we can share the data link throughout the world. The github repo link can be accessed anywhere          throughout the world. We can easily visible the code Statiscally without downloading the software in our local machine. For instance, Manager can run the output through the browser. Eventually, It saves time. \n",
